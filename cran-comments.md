## Test environments
* local Window 10 install, R 3.5.1
* osx R 3.4.4 and 3.5.0 (on travis-ci)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. An earlier submission created a note
on CRAN, due to a removed, obsolete vignette. On Travis and on Win
no NOTE is visible, and the Vignette Builder is removed, too.
