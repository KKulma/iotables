#' iotables: Working Programatically With Symmetric Input-Output Tables
#'
#' Pre-processing and basic analytical tasks related to working with 
#' Eurostat's symmetric input-output tables and provide basic 
#' input-output economics calculations. The package is 
#' a part of rOpenGov <http://ropengov.github.io/> for 
#' open source open government initiatives.

#' @section iotables import functions
#' The iotables import function help downloading and pre-processing the
#' Eurostat symmetric input-output tables and related tables.
#' 
#' @section Metadata datasets:
#' Data files that contain descriptive metadata for a correct reproduction
#' of the symmetric input-output tables.  The analytical functions use 
#' matrix equations that require a precise column and row order for each
#' table.
#' 
#' @section Validation datasets:
#' Data files that replicate published input-output tables with analysis.
#' These files are used to validate the correct working of the analytical
#' functions.
#'
#' @section Croatia data files:
#' These are Croatia's symmetric input-output tables for the year 2010, when 
#' the country was not yet an EU member state.
